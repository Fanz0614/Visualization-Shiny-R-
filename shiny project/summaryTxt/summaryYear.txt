The stacked bar plot:
We can see that the number of total casualties has a decrease trend.
However, there is a increment in 2014, but continue decreasing afterwards.
We could also find that the car casualties is always the main type of casualties, but the  sum of "bus", "cyclist" and "motor" also take a big part. Moreover, the proportion of car casualties has become smaller and smaller among years.


The line chart:
Nearly all type of casualties has a decrease trend, except "cyclist" and "van".

The increment of cyclist casualties might due to more and more people choose to commute in an environment friendly way, that is riding a bike.

The increment of van casualties might be a direct result of economy recover of UK after 2014.
